## Auralify Capstone Project

The *Auralify* app is a capstone project for the **Codecademy** ReactJS Path. This app project allowed me to demonstrate:

1. React front-end design.
2. The modularization & use of React **Components**.
3. Handling React `state` & `props` to allow for components to display & change each other.
4. The use of APIs (*specifically Spotify's API in this project*).
5. A demonstration of use **environmental variables** to hide sensitive information.
6. Static site generation using **Surge**
